== Docker Images

IMPORTANT: These tags do not map to asciidoctor release. The tags map to
a combination of all librarys in the toolchain. See `CHANGELOG.asciidoc`
for more information.

Current images:

- `ahawkins/asciidoctor:latest`
- `ahawkins/asciidoctor:0.1`, `ahawkins/asciidoctor:0.1.0`

== About

This repository contains source code to build a Docker image for
Asciidoctor. It includes:

- `asciidoctor`
- `asciidoctor-pdf`
- `asciidoctor-epub3`
- `asciidoctor-diagram`
- `pygments.rb`
- `coderay`

The goal is containerize the Asciidoctor toolchain.

== Usage

The easiest way is to mount your current directory as a volume. Here's
an example:

----
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/data" -w /data ahawkins/asiidoctor \
	asciidoctor -b html sample.asciidoc
----

This example mounts the current directory at `/data`, and sets the
working directory to `/data`. `sample.asiidoc` is written to
`/data/sample.html`.
